#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week + 1 additional day

#### Moderation

The backlog for Sprint 3:

It is to be noted that the week of Sprint #3 most members of group-012 were tested positive for Covid-19.
This created a decline in performance resulting in many issues not being completed and with the slow recovery of
each group member this issue may affect the performance of Sprint #4.

-issue#58 Add and Retrieve groups from data base: was not implemented due to time constraints. Must be implemented 
in Sprint #4.
-issue#52 Create functionality to propose geographical location: In progress. Must be finished in Sprint #4.
-issue#51 Organise online meeting: Undecisiveness and complexity of issue makes it difficult to solve. Will be attempted 
once more in Sprint #4.
-issue#49 Post links to external links & resources: was not implemented due to time constraints. Must be implemented 
in Sprint #4.
-issue#48 Search for existing groups: was not implemented due to time constraints. Must be implemented 
in Sprint #4.
-issue#31 Accept/Decline Face-to-Face meeting: was not implemented due to time constraints. Must be implemented 
in Sprint #4.
-issue#27 View application to join group: In progress. Must be implemented in Sprint #4.
-issue#26 Create "Leave group" functionality: In progress. Must be implemented in Sprint #4.
-issue#24 apply to join existing group functionality: was not implemented due to time constraints. Must be implemented 
in Sprint #4

#### Goal: 
In this Sprint, a lack of solid functionality is reoccurring, previous completed issues had bugs that had to be fixed.
The focus should be on solidify and integrating functionalities with the DB in order to obtain a successful application.
Although this spring test were done in bulk, more test are required. Styling is repetitive. 
Originality is lacking from the group.
