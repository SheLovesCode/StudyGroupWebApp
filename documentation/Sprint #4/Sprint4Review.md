#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week + 1 additional day

#### Moderation

The backlog for Sprint 4:
As was noted in the previous Sprint Review, 4 out of 5 members contracted COVID-19 and the slow recovery of the group members contributed to the decline in performance during the sprint.

Multiple functionalities that were meant to be completed in Sprint 3 were pushed to Sprint 4 increasing the workload that was due during Sprint 4. 
Sprint 4 began with 18 issues to be completed and 13 were completed and the following 5 issues were not completed:

-issue#52: Create functionality to propose geographical location: In progress. Must be finished in Sprint #4.
-issue#49: Post links to external links & resources: was not implemented due to time constraints. Must be implemented 
in Sprint #4.
-issue#76: View group member rating
-issue#75: View recommended groups
-issue#79: Receive notification of member safety

#### Final Goal Review
The goal of the sprint was partially achieved. Most of the backlog issues from Sprint 3 were cleared. However, no new tests were added due to the lack of time. Some key functionalities such viewing a member's rating are still missing from the app. 
A key aspect to note that contributed to the goal of the sprint and the project as a whole not being fully met is the technical debt that occurred as a result of implementing horizontal slices by focusing on functionality and logic wihtout implementing UI design and integrating the data base during Sprint. In addition, the lack of communication between team members on which issues were co-dependent lead to well functioning standalone funcitonalities during Sprint 3 that needed to be integrated into one web app during Sprint 4 and this also increased the technical debt.

                                #### Achieved Velocity for Sprint 3: 14
